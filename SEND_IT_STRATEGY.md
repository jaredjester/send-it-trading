# SEND IT: $390 → $3M in 3-5 Moves

**Philosophy:** Asymmetric convexity. 100% of capital. No arbitrary targets. Exit only on thesis break.

---

## The Math

**Goal:** $3M (retire forever at 4% = $120K/year passive)

**From $390 → $3M = 7,692x**

### Path 1: Compounding (SLOW DEATH)
```
30% annual × 30 years = you're 60 and broke until then
```

### Path 2: SEND IT (3-5 Asymmetric Wins)
```
Move 1: $390 → $39,000 (100x)    GME $24 → $2,400
Move 2: $39K → $1.95M (50x)      Next setup
Move 3: $1.95M → $3.9M (2x)      Cleanup trade
```

**Time: 18-36 months. Not 30 years.**

## Conviction V2 System

### Old (BROKEN):
```python
{
  'target': $45,      # ← EXIT, miss $1,000
  'max_position': 40% # ← "Diversify" into mediocrity
}
```

### New (SEND IT):
```python
{
  'thesis': "AAPL acquires GME for $80B",
  'entry': $24.89,
  'max_pain': $10,     # Below = thesis dead, EXIT
  'support': $15,      # Below = momentum dead, EXIT
  'deadline': Oct 2026,# Catalyst expires, EXIT
  'target': None,      # ← LET IT RUN TO $1,000+
  'max_position': 100% # ← ALL IN
}
```

**Exit ONLY if:**
1. Price < $10 (max pain - thesis dead)
2. Price < $15 (support broken - momentum dead)
3. Oct 2026 passes with no acquisition news
4. Ryan Cohen exits GME
5. Acquisition formally rejected

**NOT exits:**
- ❌ "Up 80%, take profit"
- ❌ "Hit $45 target"
- ❌ "Feels toppy"
- ❌ "Too concentrated"
- ❌ "Should diversify"

**If GME goes to $500, $1,000, $2,000:** HOLD until thesis breaks.

---

## Position Sizing: 100% Capital

**Current broken approach:**
- 14 positions
- GME 69%, rest scattered
- "Diversification"

**SEND IT approach:**
- 1-3 positions MAX
- 100% in convictions
- 0% in "diversification"

**Why:**
- Need 100x gains, not 20% gains
- Can't 100x with 5% position sizes
- Diversification = di-worse-ification when you have edge

**Risk management:**
- Max pain stops (thesis invalidation)
- Structure stops (momentum death)
- Time stops (catalyst expiry)
- NOT: "concentration limits"

---

## Finding Asymmetric Setups

**What we need:**

### 1. Convex Payoff Structure
- Downside: Capped at max pain (-50% to -70%)
- Upside: Unlimited (can 100x)
- Risk/Reward: 1:100+

**Examples:**
- Acquisition targets (GME, AMC if Cohen buys)
- Regulatory catalysts (XRP if SEC case won)
- Tech pivots (MSTR-style Bitcoin treasury)
- Turnarounds (deep value with catalyst)

### 2. Binary Catalyst
- Either happens or doesn't
- If happens: 10-100x
- If doesn't: Max pain exit

**GME example:**
- Catalyst: AAPL/MSFT acquires for gaming push
- Happens: $200-$500/share (10-20x)
- Doesn't happen: Exit at $10 (−60%)
- Risk $14.89, make $200+ (13:1 minimum)

### 3. Thesis You Understand
- Can articulate in one sentence
- Can identify invalidation triggers
- Can monitor catalyst progress

---

## Execution Rules

### Entry:
```
1. Thesis: What's the 10-100x catalyst?
2. Entry: Current price
3. Max Pain: Where is thesis DEAD? (set stop here)
4. Support: Where is momentum DEAD? (set stop here)
5. Deadline: When does catalyst expire?
6. Position: 100% of capital (or 50% if running 2 convictions)
```

### During:
```
HOLD through:
- ✅ 30% pullbacks
- ✅ "Feels toppy"
- ✅ Up 2x, 5x, 10x
- ✅ Negative news (if thesis intact)
- ✅ Boredom / slow price action

EXIT only on:
- ❌ Price < max pain
- ❌ Price < support
- ❌ Deadline passes, no catalyst
- ❌ Thesis explicitly invalidated
```

### Exit:
```
When exit trigger hits:
1. Sell 100% immediately
2. Record P/L
3. Find next conviction setup
4. Repeat
```

## GME Current Setup

**Conviction:**
```python
{
  'symbol': 'GME',
  'thesis': 'AAPL or MSFT acquires GME for gaming/metaverse',
  'entry': 24.89,
  'current': 23.60,
  'max_pain': 10.00,
  'support': 15.00,
  'deadline': '2026-10-31',
  'position': 100%,  # ← Go from 69% to 100%
  'exits': [
    'Price < $10',
    'Price < $15',
    'Oct 2026, no news',
    'RC exits',
    'Acquisition rejected'
  ]
}
```

**Current:** -5.2% unrealized  
**Action:** HOLD  
**If drops to $20:** BUY MORE (DCA on dip)  
**If goes to $50:** HOLD  
**If goes to $100:** HOLD  
**If goes to $500:** HOLD  
**If goes to $1,000:** HOLD  

**Exit ONLY if thesis breaks.**

## Next Setups to Watch

### Crypto Asymmetric Plays:
1. **XRP** - SEC case resolution
   - Thesis: Ripple wins, XRP not a security
   - Upside: $5-10 (10-20x from $0.50)
   - Max pain: $0.20 (case lost)

2. **SOL** - Institutional adoption
   - Thesis: ETF approval
   - Upside: $500+ (5-10x from $82)
   - Max pain: $40 (crypto winter)

### Equity Asymmetric Plays:
3. **COIN** - Regulatory clarity
   - Thesis: Crypto regulatory framework passed
   - Upside: $500+ (3-5x from $150)
   - Max pain: $60 (regulation kills crypto)

4. **Next GME-style setup** - TBD
   - Activist + catalyst
   - Deep value with binary outcome
   - 10-100x potential

## Risk Management (SENDING IT EDITION)

**NOT risk management:**
- ❌ Diversification
- ❌ Position limits
- ❌ Profit targets
- ❌ Rebalancing

**ACTUAL risk management:**
- ✅ Max pain stops (thesis dead)
- ✅ Structure stops (momentum dead)
- ✅ Time stops (catalyst expired)
- ✅ Thesis monitoring (news, events)

**Capital preservation:**
- If conviction hits max pain: EXIT with −60%
- Move to next setup
- Still have 40% capital
- Next 10x gets you back plus profit

**Example:**
```
Start: $1,000
Trade 1: -60% → $400 (max pain hit)
Trade 2: 25x → $10,000 (winner)
Trade 3: -60% → $4,000 (max pain)
Trade 4: 50x → $200,000 (winner)
```

**Even with 50% win rate, massive asymmetry = 200x total.**

## Integration with Current Bot

### Phase 1: Set GME to 100% (This Week)
```python
# Update conviction
cm.update_conviction('GME', {
    'max_position_pct': 1.0,  # 100%, not 45%
    'target_price': None,     # Remove $45 target
    'exit_on_target': False,
    'hold_until_broken': True
})

# Liquidate other positions
# Move everything into GME
# Let it ride
```

### Phase 2: Deploy Conviction V2 System
```python
# Replace conviction_manager.py with conviction_manager_v2.py
# Restart orchestrator
# GME becomes "send it" mode
# No exit until $10, $15, or Oct 2026
```

### Phase 3: Find Next Setup
```
# When GME exits (thesis breaks or 100x):
# Immediately deploy 100% into next conviction
# Rinse and repeat 3-5x until $3M
```

## The Mindset

**From Dr. Axius:**

> "The BIGGEST DUMB FUCKS win all the time here."

**Translation:**
- They don't overthink
- They don't take profit early
- They HOLD through volatility
- They survive and don't capitulate

**Our systematic version:**
- Set max pain (survive if wrong)
- Set thesis (know what you're betting on)
- HOLD until thesis breaks
- Don't exit on "feels"

**If GME goes to $1,000:**
- That's $1,000 × (370 / 24.89) = $14,877 portfolio
- From $370 → $14,877 = 40x
- From $390 → $15,000 = 38x (one move)

**From there:**
- $15K → $750K = 50x (move 2)
- $750K → $3M = 4x (move 3)

**Done in 3 moves. Retire forever. 18-36 months.**

## The Answer

**"What if GameStop goes to $1K but we sold at $45?"**

**Answer:** We don't sell at $45. We hold until thesis breaks.

**$45 is not a target. It's noise on the way to $1,000.**

**If GME goes to $1,000:**
- We're still holding
- Because acquisition hasn't happened yet
- And thesis isn't broken

**If GME goes to $5:**
- We exited at $10 (max pain)
- Lost 60%
- Still have 40% for next setup
- Next 10x makes it all back

**This is how you send it. Surgically.**

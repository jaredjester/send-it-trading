Title: Built a conviction trading system that measures real edge (IC) and holds until thesis breaks

Open source framework for capturing asymmetric returns. Includes:
- IC tracking (measures signal quality)
- Deployment gate (validates changes via backtest)
- Decision logging (full audit trail)
- Thesis-based exits (no arbitrary targets)

Built to hold positions until thesis breaks, not exit early on "take profit" vibes.

Title: Conviction trading framework with IC measurement + deployment validation

Built an eval framework for systematic conviction trading:
- Alpha tracker: IC calculation per signal
- Deployment gate: Backtest all changes before live
- Decision logger: JSONL audit trail
- Thesis-based position management

Philosophy: Measure edge, size up when proven, hold until invalidated.

Show HN: Conviction trading system – measure edge, hold until thesis breaks

[YOUR_GITHUB_LINK]

Built a framework for capturing asymmetric returns via conviction positions. 

Core components:
- IC (Information Coefficient) tracking to measure real signal edge
- Deployment gate that backtests all changes before going live
- Decision logger with full JSONL audit trail
- Conviction manager with thesis-based exits (not arbitrary targets)

Philosophy: If you find real edge (IC > 0.10), size up and hold until the thesis invalidates. No profit targets that leave 95% of gains on the table.

Example: GME conviction at $24.89, max pain at $10, no target. If it goes to $1,000, we're still holding (thesis intact). If it breaks $10, we exit (thesis dead).

Built in Python with minimal dependencies. ~17K lines including docs.

Feedback welcome!

Hey all! Just open sourced a conviction trading framework I built.

Key features:
✅ IC measurement (quantify signal edge)
✅ Deployment gate (validate changes via backtest)
✅ Decision logging (full audit trail)
✅ Thesis-based exits (hold until invalidated)

Built for capturing asymmetric moves without exiting early.

## Sample Tweet Thread

```
🧵 Thread: I built a conviction trading system and open sourced it.

1/ Problem: Vanilla options are efficiently priced (negative EV), diversification kills asymmetric returns, arbitrary profit targets leave gains on the table.

2/ Solution: Measure edge via IC (Information Coefficient), size up when proven, hold until thesis breaks.

3/ Example: GME conviction at $24.89. Exit triggers:
- Price < $10 (thesis dead)
- Price < $15 (momentum dead)  
- Oct 2026 deadline
- Acquisition rejected

NOT exits: "Up 80%", "Hit target", "Feels toppy"

4/ If GME goes to $1,000, we're still holding (thesis intact). If it breaks $10, we exit (thesis dead). 

This is how you capture 100x instead of exiting at 2x.

5/ Framework includes:
- Alpha tracker (IC measurement)
- Deployment gate (backtest validation)
- Decision logger (audit trail)
- Conviction manager (thesis-based exits)

6/ Open source: [YOUR_LINK]

Built in Python. 17K lines. MIT license.

Use at your own risk. Not financial advice.

7/ Path: $390 → $3M in 3-5 conviction trades over 18-36 months.

Not 30 years of compounding. Asymmetric wins captured surgically.

This is how you send it. 🎯
